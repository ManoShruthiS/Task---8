# Task 8 - K-Means Clustering: Mall Customer Segmentation

## 🔍 Objective
Apply unsupervised learning using K-Means Clustering on mall customers to group them into different customer segments.

## 📁 Dataset
Mall_Customers.csv – contains features like age, gender, income, and spending score.

## 📌 Steps Followed
1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Used Annual Income and Spending Score for clustering
3. Found optimal K using the Elbow Method
4. Applied K-Means with K=5
5. Visualized clusters using Seaborn
6. Evaluated results using Silhouette Score

## 📈 Results
- **Best K (clusters):** 5
- **Silhouette Score:** ~0.55
- Cluster groups were clearly identifiable by income and spending patterns.

## 📦 Libraries Used
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn
